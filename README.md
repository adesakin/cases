Requirements Gathering based on an adaption of Use Case Essentials

It is a challenge agreeing on the best approach to use in gathering requirements for an Agile Project. Debates keep going on about user stories or use cases. In my experience developing Ruby on Rails applications, user stories are a bliss but arranging those cards and making a whole sense of the whole application can easily become inundating. Though still learning from the, I seem to favour a merge between user stories and use cases (really not forcy about the diagrams because the development workflow is really in the use case descriptions). And the closest fit to this is Use Case Essential.

Ivar Jacobson came up with [Use Case Essentials 2.0](http://www.ivarjacobson.com/Use_Case2.0_ebook/) which I have been banging my head against ever so often, just to try break it down and make it simpler to use. And this is my attempt to have it implemented.
